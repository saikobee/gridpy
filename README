gridpy provides simple grid based graphics for Python. It does not provide
fancy features like pixmaps, shading, or the like. It just displays colored
squares. However, it is very customizable during runtime. You may "zoom in"
the grid, change the grid lines style with keybindings. It is also possible to
change grid colors with the API.

For more information about gridpy, view the Python documentation for it.

Examples:

    [user@computer gridpy]$ pydoc2 gridpy

    or

    [user@computer gridpy]$ python2
    >>> import gridpy
    >>> help(gridpy)
